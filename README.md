# *insert project name*
This project is an attempt at creating a tool to detect gaps in public transit coverage from both a network analysis perspective as well as an intersectional perspective.
It is part of a larger thesis project with a not-yet-started write-up [here](https://github.com/Chwiggy/thesis_bachelor)

## Installation
*yet to be determined*

## Questions
~~Can closeness centrality map on to car and public transport differences~~
Can closeness centrality work as an indicator for temporal public transport variabilty within cities? Why?


## TODOs
[x] population data and lorenz curves
[x] temporal analysis: many departure times a day, compare results: use case ebay classifieds and friends
[] think about equalizing of closeness centrality
[] compare different profiles: use classification?
[] pick different representative cells with detailed analysis
    [] from one cell to any cell over time
    [] detailed routing for outlier connections
[] group by neighbourhoods
[] compare different cities
[] difference between 10th and 90th percentile as a measure of "turning up and wait"-abilty vs a need to plan
[] temporal analysis: percentiles as planned vs. unplanned departure penalties
[] compare to car but with added door to door delays for cars
[] compare methods for schools closeness centrality and isochrone
[] open questions!
[] compare cities with different layouts
