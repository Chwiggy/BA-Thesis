# *insert project name*
This project is an attempt at creating a tool to detect gaps in public transit coverage from both a network analysis perspective as well as an intersectional perspective.
It is part of a larger thesis project with a not-yet-started write-up [here](https://github.com/Chwiggy/thesis_bachelor)

## Installation
*yet to be determined*

## Questions
Can closeness centrality map on to car and public transport differences


## TODOs
[] population data and lorenz curves
[] compare to car but with added door to door delays for cars
[] compare methods for schools closeness centrality and isochrone
[] open questions!c
[] compare cities with different layouts
